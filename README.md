Getting started.

I am a programmer who is trying to improve his skills through experimentation and continuous self-assessment.

The most important skill to have in this digital world right now is to learn how to effeciently grasp new concepts,information and retain it, and we all are lucky that an excellent resource exists that allow anyone to master this skill.

The two resources are :

1. MOOC : https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn
2. Book : https://www.amazon.in/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU
